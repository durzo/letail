letail - a crude, hacky implimentation of LogEntries Live Tail via CLI.
         LogEntries do not provide live tailing as part of the new API, so this one emulates a web browser and uses the old API.
         It works for me, and may not work for you. Use at your own risk.

         Usage: ./letail.py --help
